        <h1>Aquarium Visit: Accessible Experience for All</h1>
        <img class="img_site" src="../imgs/Vasca Ponte.jpg" alt="Inside of the aquarium in Milan">
        <p>On February 29, 2024, when we visited the aquarium in Milan, we had the opportunity to experience something unusual and unique. We did not use all our five senses, but only three, as we temporarily deprived ourselves of sight and touch, for obvious reasons. At the entrance, we were greeted by Maria, a friendly aquarium worker, who offered to guide us through this unusual visit. With her by our side, we began our sensory journey through the underwater world, relying primarily on hearing, taste, and smell. Guided by Maria's vivid and detailed descriptions, we were able to perceive the surrounding environment in new and surprising ways. The sound of waves crashing against the aquarium walls, the salty taste of the air, and the fresh, pungent smell of the ocean created an engaging and immersive atmosphere. Without the sense of sight, we found ourselves appreciating the sounds and smells of the sea more deeply and intimately, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in this extraordinary sensory experience. Thanks to Maria and her attentive and caring guidance, we were able to have an unforgettable experience, demonstrating that even without some senses, we are capable of perceiving the world around us in extraordinary and surprising ways.</p>
        <h1>Support Institution: Resources for an Inclusive Environment</h1>

        <p>After visiting the aquarium, we headed to the institution for the blind in Milan, where we had a truly unique experience. We were led into a room completely devoid of light, where darkness was total. Here, a kind girl guided us through a sensory journey based solely on touch. She presented us with a series of objects to touch and explore, including wood, shells, and sponges. With our hands, we explored the texture, shape, and consistency of each object, trying to identify them without the aid of sight. In the end, she placed a starfish in front of us, inviting us to touch it gently and explore its details. This experience made us aware of the importance of the sense of touch and allowed us to appreciate the sensory richness that surrounds us, even when deprived of sight. It was an exciting and educational experience that opened our eyes to the human capacity to adapt and perceive the world in different and surprising ways.</p>
