        <h1>History and Inclusion of People with Disabilities</h1>
        
        <h2>Greco-Roman Antiquity</h2>
        <img class="img_site" src="../imgs/2006_01_21_Athènes_Parthénon.jpeg" alt="pantheon">
        <p>In Greco-Roman antiquity, disability was seen as a defect, and people with disabilities were marginalized and considered inferior. The concept of physical perfection was central, leading to the marginalization of those who did not reflect the established standards.</p>
        
        <h2>Christian Era</h2>
        <p>With the advent of Christianity, there was a shift from a punitive view to compassion towards the disabled. However, disability continued to be seen as a divine punishment, linked to the concept of sin and blame.</p>
        
        <h2>Middle Ages</h2>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, people with disabilities were marginalized and often accused of dealings with the devil. A mentality developed that excluded them from society, leading to the opening of hospitals and asylums to separate them from the rest of the community.</p>
        
        <h2>Nazism</h2>
        <p>During Nazism, disability was subject to genocide. People with disabilities were considered lives unworthy of living, leading to sterilizations, euthanasia, and forced labor in concentration camps.</p>
        
        <h2>Contemporary Era</h2>
        <p>Since the 1970s, the rights of people with disabilities have begun to be recognized in areas such as education and work, promoting greater social inclusion. This change marked a significant turning point in the perception and rights of people with disabilities in modern society.</p>
        
        <h2>Inclusion Plan</h2>
        <img class="img_site" src="../imgs/Piano_Inclusione.jpeg" alt="Inclusion">
        <p>The Plan for the inclusion of people with disabilities includes a series of unique funding, including the Fund for the rules of the wishes of human beings with disabilities. This fund has supported legislative adjustments to respond to emerging needs and ensure adequate resources to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities. The entities for the educational provision of disabled students are regulated by the 2022 budget law, which allocates a portion of the assets of the Municipal Solidarity Fund to increase the transport of disabled university students. The resources allocated for the years 2022-2028 vary from 30 million euros in 2022 to one hundred and twenty million euros starting from 2027.</p>
        
        <h2>Non-Self-Sufficiency Norms</h2>
        <p>The norms on non-self-sufficiency and disability cover socio-health interventions dedicated to fragile classes and chronic patients. The 2020 budget regulation established the 'Fund for Disability and Non-Self-Sufficiency' with a growing endowment until 2022. The 2022 budget law introduced the 'Fund for policies in favor of people with disabilities' increasing the allocations for the years from 2023 to 2026.</p>
        
        <h2>Law 227/2021</h2>
        <p>Law no. 227 of 2021 represents a significant step in the rights of people with disabilities in Italy, delegating the Government to review existing provisions. This law is based on norms that define disability, assess disability in a multidimensional way, and promote an independent and inclusive life.</p>
        
        <h2>PNNA</h2>
        <p>The National Plan for Non-Self-Sufficiency (PNNA) for the three-year period 2022-2024 is a fundamental device aimed at ensuring access to socio-health services for non-self-sufficient people. With a focus on universality, integrated services, and consistent funding, the PNNA aims to improve access to socio-health services and promote targeted interventions.</p>
        
        <h2>CED</h2>
        <img class="img_site" src="../imgs/BlobServlet.jpeg" alt="European Disability Card">
        <p>The European Disability Card (CED) has been available since February 22, 2022, through the INPS portal, offering special rights in terms of transport, life, and entertainment for people with disabilities.</p>
